# Welcome to PokéPicker

PokéPicker is a simple application to demonstrate interaction with the **PokeAPI**. It provides access to the original 151 Pokémon, which users can filter by name as well as having the option to view a page dedicated to any Pokémon selected from the filterable list.

# Technologies used

The application uses **React JS** and a number of other helper libraries. For styling, **Tailwind CSS** is used, and for HTTP requests, **Axios** is used as a wrapper.

# Get started

_(Assuming you have node installed)_ Clone the git repository to your sites folder or wherever you prefer, **cd** into the directory and give it an **npm start** in your terminal. That should be it!
